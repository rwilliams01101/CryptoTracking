# CryptoTracking | Financial Intelligence That Pays

The CryptoTracking Team has one focus - we want to have all the cryptocurrency data you need to one place. Our application allows you to search cryptocurrency pricing, news, and data. Keeping your finger on the pulse of the market will empower you to make the most out of your investments.

## Getting Started

Our easy to navigate search list gives you the ticker symbol for each of your cryptocurrencies.
